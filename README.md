#### Option 1: Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tuannvm/viwoods-obsidian/releases)
2. Extract `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` to:
   ```
   <Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/viwoods-obsidian/
   ```
3. Enable the plugin in **Settings → Community plugins**

#### Option 2: BRAT (Beta Auto-update)

[BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) allows you to install beta versions directly from GitHub and get automatic updates.

1. Install BRAT from **Settings → Community plugins → Browse** (search for "BRAT")
2. Enable BRAT
3. Open Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P) and run: **"BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing"**
4. Paste this repository URL: `https://github.com/tuannvm/viwoods-obsidian`
5. The plugin will be installed and kept up-to-date automatically

To check for updates: run **"BRAT: Check for updates to all beta plugins"** in the Command Palette.

### Usage

Open the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd+P) and run:
- `Import Viwoods note` - Import a single `.note` file
- `Reset book hashes` - Reset import tracking

## Configuration

Configure sync behavior in **Settings → Viwoods Sync**:

### Basic Settings
- **Notes folder** - Where imported markdown files are stored
- **Include metadata** - Add YAML frontmatter with timestamps and book info
- **Include timestamps** - Add creation/modification dates to notes

### Output Format
- **Format** - Choose between PNG images, SVG strokes, or both
- **Background color** - Set background for generated images/SVG

### Auto-Sync (Desktop Only)
- **Enable auto-sync** - Watch Viwoods export folder for changes
- **Source folder path** - Path to Viwoods notes export directory
- **Polling interval** - How often to check for changes (1-60 minutes)
- **Sync on startup** - Automatically check for changes when Obsidian opens
- **Show notifications** - Display notices when changes are detected

> **Note:** Auto-sync requires desktop Obsidian. Imported notes can be viewed on any platform (desktop/mobile).

## Cloud Sync Integration

### Google Drive

Viwoods can export notes to Google Drive, making them accessible across devices. To sync with Obsidian:

1. **Install Google Drive Desktop** (Google Drive for desktop)
   - Download from https://www.google.com/drive/download/
   - Sign in and sync your Viwoods folder to your local filesystem

2. **Configure Viwoods Export**
   - In Viwoods app, set the export location to your Google Drive folder
   - Typical path: `~/Google Drive/My Drive/Viwoods/` or similar

3. **Set Up Obsidian Auto-Sync**
   - **Source folder path**: Point to your local Google Drive sync folder
     - Example: `/Users/<username>/Google Drive/My Drive/Viwoods/`
   - **Enable auto-sync**: Turn on to watch for changes
   - **Polling interval**: Set to 1-5 minutes for near real-time sync

4. **How It Works**
   - When Viwoods exports notes to Google Drive → Google Drive desktop syncs locally
   - Obsidian plugin detects changes → Auto-imports to your vault
   - Works bidirectionally: changes on any device sync through Google Drive

### Viwoods Cloud Backup

Viwoods (v3.6+) supports built-in sync to Google Drive, OneDrive, and Dropbox. See the [official sync guide](https://viwoods.com/blogs/paper-tablet/file-sync-and-share-across-devices) and this [community tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/viwoods/comments/1od4690/seamless_automatic_synchronization_across_devices/).

#### Quick Setup with Obsidian

1. **Enable Viwoods Cloud Sync**
   - Viwoods Settings → Cloud Sync → Link account (Google Drive/OneDrive/Dropbox)
   - Select notebooks to sync, enable auto-sync

2. **Install Desktop Sync Client**
   - [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) | [OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/download) | [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/install)

3. **Configure Plugin Auto-Sync**
   - **Source folder path**: Point to your local cloud sync folder
     - Google Drive: `~/Google Drive/My Drive/Viwoods/`
     - OneDrive: `~/OneDrive/Viwoods/` (macOS) or `C:\Users\<user>\OneDrive\Viwoods\` (Windows)
     - Dropbox: `~/Dropbox/Apps/Viwoods/`
   - **Enable auto-sync**: ON
   - **Polling interval**: 1-5 minutes

### Platform Support

| Platform | Auto-Sync | Viewing |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Windows/macOS/Linux** | Full support | Full |
| **iOS/Android** | N/A | View imported notes |

### Troubleshooting Cloud Sync

- **Sync delays**: Google Drive desktop may take 30-60 seconds to sync files after Viwoods export
- **Path issues**: Use absolute paths (e.g., `/Users/...` on macOS, `C:\Users\...` on Windows)
- **Permissions**: Ensure Obsidian has read access to the cloud sync folder
- **Network issues**: Auto-sync requires internet connection for cloud providers to sync locally
